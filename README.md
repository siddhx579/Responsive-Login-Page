# Responsive-Login-Page
 This repository contains the code for a responsive login form built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The login form has two panels, one for signing in and the other for signing up. The user can switch between the panels by clicking the "Sign In" or "Sign Up" buttons.

The CSS code sets the container div to be centered both horizontally and vertically, and it sets the height of the container div to be 100% of the viewport height. The sign-up-mode class sets the background color of the container div to black and the text color to white.
